Hands-on 4: Difference between JPA, Hibernate, and Spring Data JPA


Java Persistence API (JPA)
- JPA is a specification (JSR 338) used to persist, read and manage data from Java objects.
- It doesn’t provide any implementation on its own.
- Hibernate is one of the popular implementations of JPA.


Hibernate
- Hibernate is an ORM (Object Relational Mapping) tool that implements JPA.
- It manages database operations using Java classes.
- We use Session, Transaction, etc., in Hibernate to perform CRUD operations.


Spring Data JPA
- Spring Data JPA doesn’t implement JPA itself but provides an abstraction over JPA and Hibernate.
- It helps reduce a lot of boilerplate code.
- It internally manages transactions and simplifies database access using interfaces like JpaRepository.
