After implementing linear and binary search, we analyzed their time complexities.

- Linear Search:
  Time Complexity = O(n)
  Works on unsorted data.
  Slower for large datasets.

- Binary Search:
  Time Complexity = O(log n)
  Requires sorted data.
  Much faster for large datasets.

Conclusion:
Binary Search is more suitable for e-commerce platforms as it provides faster results,
which is important for customer satisfaction and performance. However, the data must
be sorted, so real-world systems often use indexing or advanced search data structures
for optimization.

This implementation demonstrates the importance of algorithm choice in search functionality.
