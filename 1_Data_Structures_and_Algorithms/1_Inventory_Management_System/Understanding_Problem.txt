In a warehouse inventory system, efficiency in data storage and retrieval is critical,
especially when dealing with hundreds or thousands of products.

Why Data Structures & Algorithms Matter:

- Efficient algorithms reduce time in locating, updating, or deleting products.
- The right data structure ensures scalability, making the system responsive even as data grows.

Suitable Data Structures:
1. ArrayList – Good for sequential access but slow for lookups by ID (O(n)).
2. HashMap – Best for quick lookups using unique keys (productId). Offers O(1) average time for add, update, delete.

For this system, we choose HashMap<Integer, Product> to store products with productId as the key.
